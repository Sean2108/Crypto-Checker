# Crypto-Checker
Simple shell and python scripts to check price for selected portfolio from CoinMarketCap.

To use, edit tracked_crypto.txt so that it contains the symbols of the coins in your portfolio. (eg. BTC, ETH)
Then, place the 3 files in the same directory and add the following line to your .bashrc:

sh path/to/crypto_checker.sh

On terminal startup, the prices of each cryptocurrency in your portfolio will be listed in USD.
